## Background

### Genetic Algorithm
GA is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that are used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.

### Game of Life
The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.


### Implementation
(1)Create a genetic algorithm to find the best pattern which can have max Generations (2)Create fitness function which used to judge the performance and to find the best pattern (3)Create selection function (4)Create mutate function achieve the mutation of chromosome (5)Successfully distinguish between genotype and phenotype (6)Create functions' unit test and pass all (7)Design UI to show the result(best pattern)
